## Problem: Portals
## You've found yourself in a grid of cells with R rows and C columns. The cell
## in the ith row from the top and jth column from the left contains one of the
## following (indicated by the character G{i,j}:

##  -   If G{i,j} = '.', the cell is empty.
##  -   If G{i,j} = 'S', the cell contains your starting position. There is
#       exactly one such cell.
##  -   If G{i,j} = 'E', the cell contains an exit. There is at least one such
##      cell.
##  -   If G{i,j} = '#', the cell contains a wall.
##  -   Otherwise, if G{i,j} is a lowercase letter (between "a" and "z",
##      inclusive), the cell contains a portal marked with that letter.

## Your objective is to reach any exit from your starting position as quickly as
## possible. Each second, you may take either of the following actions:

##  -   Walk to a cell adjacent to your current one (directly above, below, to
##      the left, or to the right), as long as you remain within the grid and
##      that cell does not contain a wall.
##  -   If your current cell contains a portal, teleport to any other cell in
##      the grid containing a portal marked with the same letter as your current
##      cell's portal.

## Determine the minimum number of seconds required to reach any exit, if it's
## possible to do so at all. If it's not possible, return -1 instead.

## Constraints:
## 1 <= R, C <= 50
## G{i,j} âˆˆ {'.', 'S', 'E', '#', 'a' ... 'z'}
